        <p>Hi {{ stallholder.first_name }},</p>
        <br>
        <p>You have been pre-allocated the following site(s)based on your historical usage at the upcoming {{ fair.fair_name }}:</p>

        <ul>
            {% for allocation in allocations %}
                <li>Event and Site : {{ allocation.event_site }}
            {% endfor %}
        </ul>

        <p>Please log into the Martinborough Fair system to secure these site(s) before {{ fair.activation_date|date:"D d M Y" }} to complete the process.</p>

        <p>We are using a new Fair Management system. Your username is your email address - the one this email was sent to. You will need to use the "Forgot Password" function initially to set your password. Once completed, you can log in with your newly created password. The system will also ask you to verify your email address.</p>

        <p>The new system includes an internal comments function, and we encourage you to use this for any communications with the Fair Convener regarding special requirements, issues, etc.</p>

        <p>If you are not intending to attend the {{ fair.fair_name }}, please advise the <a href="mailto:convener@martinboroughfair.org.nz">convener</a> by email, or preferably by using the system's comments function, so the site(s) can be released for other stallholders.</p>

        <p><em>Fair Convener</em></p>
