        question: Are there any cash-out facilities
        answer: 'There are two ATM’s in Martinborough situated on Kitchener Street
            in close proximity.   Note: there is often a queue for both machines and
            they have been known to run out on Fair day so it is advisable to bring
            cash with you.   A number of stallholders do have mobile EFTPOS available
            as well.  Each year we try to have the ANZ ATM module on site.  It houses
            four ATMs.  If it''s available, the unit will be set up outside the Fire
            Station on Texas Street East (Opposite the playground/Town Hall/Waihenga
            center)'

        answer: "We would appreciate it if you leave your dog(s) at home. \r\n\r\nWith
            up to 30,000 people attending the Fair there is not much room for dogs
            on leashes in amongst all those human legs. \r\n\r\nTemperatures in Martinborough
            can often be in the high 20’s if not low 30’s at the Fair being in summer,
            and the majority of stalls are on the road so it can’t be very nice for
            your pet pooch walking on hot asphalt with no water readily available"

        question: How do I get to the Martinborough Fair
        answer: "There are several ways of getting to Martinborough.  The most direct
            way if travelling from Wellington via the Rimutaka Hill is via [SH53](https://www.google.co.nz/maps/dir/Featherston,+Wellington/Martinborough/@-41.1678676,175.3213715,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x6d40cbda6016546d:0x500ef6143a2c310!2m2!1d175.3230691!2d-41.116798!1m5!1m1!1s0x6d472d633665d94d:0x500ef6143a2e0e0!2m2!1d175.4600651!2d-41.2190932!3e0
            )which goes from Featherston at the foot of the Rimutaka Hill Road through
            to Martinborough. \r\nAs this is the most direct route it can also be
            very busy so an alternate route which may take 20 minutes longer but will
            avoid the usual traffic build up can be found [here](https://www.google.co.nz/maps/dir/Featherston,+Wellington/-41.3055443,175.2741616/Martinborough/@-41.2115996,175.2913277,12z/data=!4m15!4m14!1m5!1m1!1s0x6d40cbda6016546d:0x500ef6143a2c310!2m2!1d175.3230691!2d-41.116798!1m0!1m5!1m1!1s0x6d472d633665d94d:0x500ef6143a2e0e0!2m2!1d175.4600651!2d-41.2190932!3e0)\r\n\r\nTravelling
            from Greytown you can come down Bidwills Cutting Road at the southern
            end of Greytown If you are coming from further north of Carterton the
            best route is via [Ponatahi Road](https://www.google.co.nz/maps/dir/Carterton,+Wellington/Martinborough/@-41.1239813,175.4303537,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x6d40d0aa7bf21045:0x500ef6143a29906!2m2!1d175.5235181!2d-41.0291733!1m5!1m1!1s0x6d472d633665d94d:0x500ef6143a2e0e0!2m2!1d175.4600651!2d-41.2190932!3e0).
            You should be prepared to spend some time in a queue as there are regularly

        question: How do I apply for a stall – I was a stall holder previously.
        answer: "Previous stallholders will have registered on this site already and
            have an account with a email address and a password. \r\n\r\nIf you have
            NOT yet Signed Up on this site, you will need to do so using the Sign
            Up button.  If you are told that the email address is already in use,
            that means you do already have an account, and you need to try to remember
            your user email address and password.\r\n\r\nIf you can't remember them
            read the forgotten credentials FAQ (under the logging in tab) about it
            before emailing for assistance.\r\n\r\nSo, assuming you have registered
            your account:\r\n\r\nLog in to our web-site using the Log In button and
            select the 'Site Application' button on the MyFair dashboard  to APPLY
            for your stall for the current year.  \r\n\r\nOnce you have submitted
            your application, remember to pay your stall fee. If paying by Bank transfer,
            our bank account number will be provided on your application acknowledgement
            email.\r\n\r\nWhen we receive your payment, we can evaluate your proposal

            to both fairs.\r\n\r\nThe prices will depend on your setup \r\n\r\nNormally,
            if a stallholder decides not to come to one fair or the other, they should
            let us know and we will try to fill the spare slot, and if we can, we
            will consider a refund, subject to administration cost retention policies

        answer: "The Martinborough Fair normally operates over two days, but we have
            separated the days by one month.\r\n\r\nThis has the advantage of offering
            our stallholders and visitors a better chance of a successful day's business
            each year as it would be very unusual for both days to suffer from adverse
            weather or other limiting conditions.\r\n\r\nAs a result, we expect stallholders
            to commit to both Fair days on application.\r\n\r\nIf you are unable to
            make it on one or other of the scheduled days, you still apply and pay
            for both, but let us know in your application what your plans are.\r\n\r\nIt
            is not always easy to fill a single fair day, but we will try to get a
            replacement on your behalf and if we are successful, may consider refunding
            one day's site fees less an administration fee."

            and licensing requirements.\r\n\r\nStall sites may be shared, but not
            sub-let.\r\n\r\nThe site cost may be shared, but for no more than a reasonable
            share of the established site fee.\r\n\r\nAll products intended to be
            on sale are to be listed on the application form, and the fact that the
            stall is to be shared noted in comments, but one person will take responsibility
            for application, payment and dealing with fair management regarding all

            to be turned down.\r\n\r\nIt will only be on grounds such as unsuitable
            product lines, incompatible site requirements (e.g. unusual power or size
            requirements) or previous misbehaviour, that an application will be declined.\r\n\r\nCheck
            the Stallholder Guidelines for information on site restrictions.  If you
            satisfy all the criteria, you will probably be welcomed to the Fair.\r\n\r\nOnce
            we are approaching capacity, we will advertise the fact on this website
            and when full, we will still take applications from those who wish to
            be put on the waiting list.\r\n\r\nIf we are unable to accommodate you
            for any reason, your site application fees will be refunded in full.\r\n\r\n
            \r\n\r\nNotes: Getting your application in as soon as applications open
            will help in stall allocations.\r\n\r\nReturning stallholders who apply
            and pay in October will be processed during October.  \r\n\r\nFrom the
            1st of November on, all PAID applications are processed in a first-come
            first-served basis."

        question: Refunds
        answer: "Refunds will be made at the discretion of the Convener based on the
            reason you are unable to make it to one or both of the Fair Days.  If
            the Convener is advised more than two weeks prior to the February Fair
            date, a refund is possible, although 25% of the claimed amount may be
            retained as an Administration fee.\r\n\r\nNo refunds will be given due
            to inclement weather or any other circumstances beyond our control."

        question: I am unable to attend the (Feb/Mar) market but would like to attend
            the other Fair. Is that possible?
        answer: "The Martinborough Fair normally operates over two days, but we have
            separated the days by one month.\r\n\r\nThis has the advantage of offering
            our stallholders and visitors a better chance of a successful day's business
            each year as it would be very unusual for both days to suffer from adverse
            weather or other limiting conditions.\r\n\r\nAs a result, we expect stallholders
            to commit to both Fair days on application.\r\n\r\nIf you are unable to
            make it on one or other of the scheduled days, you still apply and pay
            for both, but let us know in your application what your plans are.\r\n\r\nIt
            is not always easy to fill a single fair day, but we will try to get a
            replacement on your behalf and if we are successful, may consider refunding
            one day's site fees less an administration fee."

        question: If I arrive on Friday evening where can I stay in the vicinity of
            Martinborough?
        answer: "Some stallholders camp in their caravan on the road around the square
            somewhere near their stall site on Friday night so they can make an early
            start to setting up. (Please don't camp in the grassed area of the square)\r\n\r\nBooking
            of more formal accommodation needs to be arranged well ahead due to the
            popularity of the Fair.  Many late-comers find they can only find accommodation
            as far away as the Hutt Valley or Masterton."

        question: Powered sites
        answer: "There are 7 power supply boxes around the Fair for use by stallholders
            who have applied for power.\r\n\r\nIt is the responsibility of each power
            user to provide their own extension leads to connect to the power outlets
            and to ensure all cables and appliances are safe and have been tested
            and tagged.\r\n\r\nAll cables that are exposed to foot traffic must also
            be protected mechanically. Strips of gaffer tape will not be adequate.
            \ Use carpet strips or purpose made cable covers that will withstand 50,000
            feet standing on them and being kicked and pummeled by feet and wheels
            all day.\r\n\r\n#### Oxford street and Cambridge Road\r\n\r\n- These two
            distribution boxes plugged in, which are sited at ground level.\r\n- RCD
            units are incorporated into the distribution boards or their supply points\r\n-
            Any cables exposed to foot traffic must also be physically protected.
            Gaffer tape is not enough. Lengths of carpet or purpose built cable covers
            must be used.\r\n\r\n#### Mitre 10 Car park\r\n\r\n- Powered sites in
            the Mitre 10 car park can run leads in through the Mitre 10 roller doorway
            or from Pain and Kershaw. Use RCD protection for these supplies.\r\n-
            There is a three phase supply point under the veranda in front of Nara
            café which we can hire a distribution box for if there are enough enough
            power users (currently $400 for the 2 days)\r\n\r\n#### Memorial Square
            (under the trees)\r\n\r\nFour power boxes are mounted on poles around
            the South-Western sides of the square. One opposite the Martinborough
            Hotel, one opposite the Mitre 10 car park, and two are mounted over the
            road from the Jellicoe Street entrance. \r\n\r\nAll these four power box
            outlets are already protected by RCD units back at the main supply panel.
            Users must still ensure all cables and equipment connected to these boxes
            are certified safe. \r\n\r\n#### Memorial square atrium\r\n\r\nThe main
            power distribution box in the middle of the square will have a few spare
            outlets for use by stallholders who have applied and paid. They are all
            protected by RCDs."

        answer: "Yes, there are a limited number of stalls where electricity can be

            Extension cords\r\n\r\nAll extension cords are the responsibility of the
            stallholder and must be adequately protected where crossing public areas.
            All electrical equipment used on your stall must be tested and tagged
            by an authorised tester.\r\n\r\n#### Generators\r\n\r\nGenerators will
            only be allowed under special circumstances and with prior written approval.
            \ If circumstances are deemed to warrant the use of a generator it will
            be required to meet stringent noise and emission standards and must be

        question: When should I set up my stall
        answer: "Our traffic management plan as filed with Transit NZ calls for road
            closures between the hours of 8am and 4pm on Saturday, and the District
            Council allows us to use public reserve areas during the same times.\r\n\r\nWe
            are allowed some setup/tear-down time, so cars may use the roads while
            sites are being set up, typically from about 4am to 7:30am for set-up,
            and tear-down time from 4pm to around 5pm.\r\n\r\nRoads around Martinbourough
            Square are open and may not be obstructed outside those times.\r\n\r\nOnce
            set up, the Fair runs from 8:00 am – 4:00 pm officially but we often have
            people “shopping” from 7:00 am onwards. \r\n\r\nMany stallholders start
            setting up in the small hours of the morning with the centre of Martinborough
            buzzing by 5:00 am. \r\n\r\nYour car/van/truck needs to be outside the
            road closure area by 7:30am so it's probably a good idea to aim at arriving
            in Martinborough no later than 6:00am to unload, get the car parked somewhere
            away from the stall areas and set up your stall ready for a busy day."

        question: Food Stall licensing
        answer: "The District Council keeps a very close eye on food preparation and
            provision at the Fair.If you are selling ANY food, whether you are preparing
            it yourself in some way, or simply on-selling packaged human consumable
            food, you MUST have been issued a licence to do so for this event specifically.\r\n\r\nPrevious
            licences or permissions for other events are not considered valid and
            you risk being closed down on the day if you do not comply.\r\n\r\nFood
            stall providing food that can be consumed at the Fair should apply
            under the Food/Drink (consumable on site) Category, other foodstuffs like
            honey, water, olive oil or packaged tea/coffee etc, should choose Food/Drink
            (Other).\r\n\r\nOn-site food stalls will contribute towards health and
            safety costs, as well as the SWDC licensing fees. ($60)\r\n\r\nPackaged
            product will only incur the licensing fee ($20)\r\n\r\nThe stall application
            form will include a section where you can provide all the information
            required to applying for a SWDC food stall license. If the applicant is
            a registered food business, they will need to provide a scanned copy of
            their current Application certificate.\r\n\r\nWe will forward the application
            information to the Council and pay any fees, and they will contact the
            applicant if there are any questions.\r\n\r\nThe Council will evaluate
            your application and then inform the Convener of their decision, at which
            point, we will be able to finalise your stall allocation."

        question: Food Trucks
        answer: "Sites are nominally 6x3 metres but there are sites at the end of
            a row, or street, or in open areas that could be used to accommodate a
            bigger vehicle.  But we need to know about it before-hand.  Sites are
            not flexible, they are pre-marked in grids and there is no leeway.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe
            also need to know about extractor positions so we don't place you next
            to a clothing stall with the resultant danger of claims being made against
            you for damage."

        question: Buskers
        answer: "#### The Martinborough Fair is a fun day for visitors and we welcome
            musical entertainment that adds to the enjoyment of everyone associated
            with the Fair. \r\n\r\nAlthough the streets and parks of the  Martinborough
            village precinct, including Memorial Square, are ‘closed’ for the duration
            of the Fair, we follow the South Wairarapa District Council’s policy relating
            to music in the public space.  In particular we refer to the sections
            about volume and appropriate lyrics. that basically says – Any person
            busking or conducting a street performance, or other such activity must
            not cause any nuisance or obstruction to any person using any public place
            \   \r\n\r\nOur intention is to enable musicians to also have fun while
            performing at the Fair, so these few guidelines are designed to avoid
            issues or problems that are foreseeable, especially relating to site/location
            and amplified volume: \r\n\r\n- On arrival at the Fair go to the Information
            Centre in the middle of the Square. You’ll be introduced to whomever is
            liaising with musicians on that day. There are some dedicated sites for
            musicians, and you’ll be assisted to find your site(s).\r\n- Some sites
            are more popular that others so, to rotate access, we ask that you play
            for no more than an hour before moving on to another site. So not only
            will you get to play in a different place, it also gives the stall holders
            adjacent to the site a variation in music throughout the day.\r\n- Volume
            of music and speech through amps and PA systems is the most common cause
            of complaint, and it’s an issue we and you can simply avoid through good
            communication, especially by occasionally checking with neighbouring stall
            holders. \r\n- Amplified music should not, in general, be significantly
            louder than acoustic production. Generally, if your neighbours are comfortable
            with your volume and music style, then all is well.\r\n\r\n**NB** Most
            of our musicians are solo, duo or trio.  For larger bands we have set
            aside the staging area in front of the Town Hall where higher amplification
            is suitable.  Performance times in this location are usually programmed
            prior to the Fair day, so if you wish to book a playing time please contact
            us.   We want you, together with everyone else at our Fair, to have a
            good day.  We don’t expect to have disputes but if that happens then the
            situation can (if your efforts fail) be resolved by our music coordinator.
            \ \r\n\r\nFor any issues on the day, contact our head office on the day
            at the Fire Station in Texas Street East."
